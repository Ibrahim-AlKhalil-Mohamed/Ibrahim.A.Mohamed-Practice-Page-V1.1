<h1>Forms </h1>

<p> Forms in HTML are fundamental components for collecting and 
    processing user input on web pages. They are constructed 
    using the <mark> &ltform&gt </mark> tag and contain various input elements 
        such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and 
        dropdown menus. Forms enable users to submit data, 
        interact with applications, and perform actions like 
        signing up, logging in, or providing feedback. By 
        utilizing CSS styling, forms can be visually enhanced 
        to align with the website's design aesthetic, ensuring 
        a cohesive user experience. From contact forms to 
        registration pages, forms facilitate crucial 
        interactions between users and websites, making 
        them indispensable elements in web development. 
        Below, explore some examples of forms :</p>


<div style="text-align: center">

    <h1>Buttons</h1>

    <p>
        Buttons in HTML are essential elements for user interaction
        on web pages. They are created using the &ltbutton&gt tag
        or &ltinput&gt elements with the type="button" attribute.
        Buttons provide a clickable interface, allowing users to
        trigger actions or submit forms. With CSS styling, buttons
        can be customized in terms of appearance, size, color, and
        hover effects, enhancing the overall user experience.
        They play a crucial role in navigation, form submissions,
        and executing various functions within a website or web
        application. To demonstrate , here are some buttons below :</p>

    <h1> Headings</span></h1>
    <p>
        HTML header tags are used to define headings within a 
        webpage, structuring content hierarchically to convey 
        importance and organization. They range from &lt h1 &gt to 
        &lt h6 &gt, with &lt h1 &gt being the most significant and
        &lt h6 &gt the least. For example: </p>

<br>
<br>

       <div align="center">
    <h1>This is the largest text </h1>
    <h2>This is the second largest text</h2>
    <h3>This is the third largest text</h3>

    <h5>This is the fifth largest text</h5>

<h1>Tables </h1>

<p>
    Tables in HTML are structures used to organize and display
     data in rows and columns. They consist of elements like
     <span><b> &lt table &gt, &lt tr &gt , &lt td &gt, and 
        &lt th &gt</b></span>, 
      allowing for the creation of grids or complex layouts.
       Tables are versatile tools for presenting information 
       systematically on web pages. An example of how this is utilised
       can be found below:</p>

<h3 align="center">Working hours <small>(hover for more information)</small></h3>

<table align="center" title="Nothing to see here" bgcolor="black"

    the align changes where the text is alligned-->

<h1>iFrames</h1>

<p> iframes are  HTML documents embedded inside another HTML 
    document , like mini windows in a webpage, allowing
     you to display content from other sources seamlessly. 
     These versatile elements let me embed videos, maps, or 
     other websites into my own page.Some websites employ 
     techniques to block the embedding of their content within
